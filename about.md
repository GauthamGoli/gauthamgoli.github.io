I'm a final year undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ac.in). I'm interested in web development and technology in general. Using technology to solve real world problems and doing interesting stuff is what drives me. I have been coding in Python for the past 3 years, developed various scalable web applications along the way. I am primarily a backend guy although I have worked on front end development using bootstrap, ReactJS. 

I also love open source.

My resume is available on [request](mailto:goligautham@protonmail.com).
