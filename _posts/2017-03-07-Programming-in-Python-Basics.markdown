Recently, I had to present a lecture to newly recruited programmers at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co) on Python Programming. It was an internal lecture only for the members of SDSLabs. We also hold open lectures on various topic ranging from HTML/CSS , Software Development, to Machine Learning and Information Security.

The lecture that I presented was relatively a shorter one, took about ~ 2.5 hours. It covers the very basics of writing programs using Python3. Nothing fancy like meta programming.

The slides:
